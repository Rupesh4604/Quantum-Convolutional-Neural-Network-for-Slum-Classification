# Quantum-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Slum-Classification

This study explores the novel application of Quantum ConvolutionalNeural Networks (QCNNs) for slum classification using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. While traditional machine learning models and deep CNNs have been employed for informal settlement detection, they often struggle with class imbalance, high intra-class variability, and limited training data. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical model based on Multi-Channel Quantum Image (MCQI) encoding and evaluate its performance against a structurally analogous classical CNN. To address the significant class imbalance in the dataset, we apply a stratified sampling strategy based on spectral intensity binning. Our results demonstrate that the QCNN achieves superior performance, particularly on the minority (slum) class, with a test accuracy of 94.8% and an F1-score of 0.933, outperforming the classical CNN baseline. Ablation studies confirm the importance of sampling strategy and label purity thresholds. These findings underscore the potential of quantum learning architectures in remote sensing tasks with limited or imbalanced data.
